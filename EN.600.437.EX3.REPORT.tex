Each trial consists of sending a total of 600,000 packets amongst a group of 8 machines. 6 of the machines are sending 100,000 packets each and the other 2 are listening. From our results, our protocol sends at an average rate of 337.86 Mib/s but this value seems to fluctuate with server load. At the time of testing we did not get entirely consistant results as seen from trials 3 and 5 being a good amount faster than the other three trials. This performance in comparison to the performance of our protocol from the second practical exercise is pretty undesirable. Of course there must be room for improvement by properly tweaking flow control.
